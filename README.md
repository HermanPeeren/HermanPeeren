## Herman Peeren

Independent, creative software builder. Been around from punch cards to cloud computing. Proponent of a model driven approach.

I like modelling. When creating software you first make a model of the problem and solution. That is what philosophers have been doing for ages: building a model in order to better understand the complex world around us. The model and the modelling language are abstractions, found in a creative process.
